* Completely overhaul adding repos and mirrors, both UX and code

* Preview repo contents before adding

* Use Session Installer on F-Droid and F-Droid Basic including support for automatic background updates

* On Android 14, mark apps with unsupported Target SDK Version as incompatible #2692

* Long click to copy Links, Permissions and Versions on App Details screen (thanks @Tobias_Groza)
