     * Get a remote file, checking the HTTP response code, if it has changed since

     * If the {@code ETag} does not match, it could be caused by the previous
     * download of the same file coming from a mirror running on a different
     * webserver, e.g. Apache vs Nginx.  {@code Content-Length} and
     * {@code Last-Modified} are used to check whether the file has changed since
     * those are more standardized than {@code ETag}.  Plus, Nginx and Apache 2.4
     * defaults use only those two values to generate the {@code ETag} anyway.
     * Unfortunately, other webservers and CDNs have totally different methods
     * for generating the {@code ETag}.  And mirrors that are syncing using a
     * method other than {@code rsync} could easily have different {@code Last-Modified}
     * times on the exact same file.  On top of that, some services like GitHub's
     * raw file support {@code raw.githubusercontent.com} and GitLab's raw file
     * support do not set the {@code Last-Modified} header at all.  So ultimately,
     * then {@code ETag} needs to be used first and foremost, then this calculated
     * {@code ETag} can serve as a common fallback.
     * <p>
     * In order to prevent the {@code ETag} from being used as a form of tracking
     * cookie, this code never sends the {@code ETag} to the server.  Instead, it
     * uses a {@code HEAD} request to get the {@code ETag} from the server, then
     * only issues a {@code GET} if the {@code ETag} has changed.
     * <p>
     * This uses a integer value for {@code Last-Modified} to avoid enabling the
     * use of that value as some kind of "cookieless cookie".  One second time
     * resolution should be plenty since these files change more on the time
     * space of minutes or hours.
